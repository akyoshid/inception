; Pool name declaration
; - PHP-FPM can manage multiple pools
; - Each pool has independent settings and worker processes
; - Example: [www] [admin] [api], etc., can be separated by purpose
[www]

; User/Group that executes the process
; www-data:
; - Standard web server user on Debian/Ubuntu
; - Has only minimal privileges (security)
user = www-data
group = www-data

; Listen on all interfaces for Docker networking
listen = 0.0.0.0:9000

; Process manager settings (balanced for small container)
pm = dynamic
pm.max_children = 10
pm.start_servers = 3
pm.min_spare_servers = 2
pm.max_spare_servers = 5
pm.max_requests = 500

; Whether to clear environment variables
; Why no: To pass Docker environment variables to PHP
clear_env = no

; Whether to capture the worker's output
; Why yes: Have the parent process receive PHP error output
;           so it can be viewed with docker logs
catch_workers_output = yes

; PHP settings for WordPress
php_admin_value[memory_limit] = 128M
